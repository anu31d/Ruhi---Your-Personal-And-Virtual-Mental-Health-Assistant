## 2. Problem Statement

### AI for Mental Health Screening and Intervention

Mental health challenges such as stress, anxiety, and emotional distress are increasingly prevalent in today’s fast-paced world. However:

- Access to affordable and timely mental health support is limited  
- Social stigma prevents individuals from seeking help  
- Traditional mental health services are not always available 24/7  

### Why This Matters

- Suicide is among the leading causes of death among young adults  
- Millions of individuals silently struggle with mental health challenges each year  

There is an urgent need for accessible, stigma-free, and immediate mental health support.
